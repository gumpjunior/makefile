lab2:
    *How to run:
        make -f makefile2
    *explanation:

lab3:
    *How to run:
        make -f makefile3
    *explanation:
        According to lab2, command in each section will be running by running makefile.
        So when in makefile3, by running default section "all", will compile and generate "runme".

lab4:
    *How to run:
        make -f makefile4 command_ls
    *explanation:
        1. By specifying section namei(in this example, it is "command_ls") following the makefile name, that section is gonna be run.
        2. When one section is called to be running, the sub-section name(in this example, it is "tag_ls") follows the section name(command_ls) will be running one by one.
        3. The sub-section(tag_ls) will be called AUTOMATICALLY if the parent section(commabd_ls) is called.
